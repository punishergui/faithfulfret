# USB Audio & Recording

Use this section for quick setup notes when connecting the amp to a computer.

## Checklist

1. Connect USB cable directly (avoid unstable hubs).
2. Select the amp as input/output device in DAW or OS audio settings.
3. Set monitoring levels conservatively to avoid clipping.
4. Record dry/clean reference takes before layering effects.

## Troubleshooting

- No device shown: reconnect USB and restart DAW.
- Distorted audio: lower gain and interface/track input level.
- Latency: reduce buffer size where stable.
