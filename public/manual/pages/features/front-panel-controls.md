## Signal chain

1. Guitar input
2. Pre gain / amp voice
3. EQ section (low, mid, high)
4. Effects/modulation/delay/reverb
5. Post/master volume to speaker output

## Practical control notes

- **Input**: if silent, verify guitar volume knob and cable first.
- **Gain**: increase for drive/sustain; keep lower for chord clarity.
- **EQ**: cut bass first to remove mud, then shape mids/highs.
- **Post Volume**: level-match presets to avoid sudden jumps.
- **Effects**: subtle mix settings help practice articulation.

## Numbered callouts

1. Start from a clean patch.
2. Set gain before heavy effects.
3. Dial EQ while strumming full chords.
4. Raise volume only after tone is set.
