# Factory Reset & Recovery

Use reset only when needed and after documenting key presets.

## Before reset

- Write down important gain/EQ/effects settings.
- Export/backup any external project/session notes.
- Confirm issue persists after power cycle and cable checks.

## After reset

1. Start with clean patch.
2. Re-check guitar cable and input.
3. Rebuild one baseline preset first.
