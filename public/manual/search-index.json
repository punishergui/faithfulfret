Effects/modulation/delay/reverb 5. Post/master volume to speaker output Practical control notes Input : if silent, verify guitar volume knob and cable first. Gain : increase for drive/sustain; keep lower for chord clarity. EQ : cut bass first to remove mud, then shape mids/highs. Post Volume : level match presets to avoid sudden jumps. Effects : subtle mix settings help practice articulation. Numbered callouts 1. Start from a clean patch. 2. Set gain before heavy effects. 3. Dial EQ while strumming full chords. 4. Raise volume only after tone is set. Related: Getting Started, No Sound Troubleshooting, Factory Reset & Recovery.",

Select the amp as input/output device in DAW or OS audio settings. 3. Set monitoring levels conservatively to avoid clipping. 4. Record dry/clean reference takes before layering effects. Troubleshooting No device shown: reconnect USB and restart DAW. Distorted audio: lower gain and interface/track input level. Latency: reduce buffer size where stable.
